different programming languages and libraries;

## JavaScript, HTML5 and [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/)

* [IOSF Website](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/IOSF-website)

## Anything New

* as long as it works, and you can demonstrate it works, and it
  doesn't make something more complicated than it needs to be, it is
  probably welcome.
